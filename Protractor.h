  A lot of sensors can tell the distance to an object, but determining the angle to an object is much harder. 
  With a 180 degree field of view, the Protractor can sense open pathways and tell the angle to multiple 
  objects up to 30cm (12 inches) away.  With a Protractor mounted to your mobile robot, you can easily find 
  or avoid objects.

  The Protractor is designed to work well with Mini Sumo robots, and can also be used as a general purpose 
  proximity sensor.
