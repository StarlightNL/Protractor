/* PROTRACTOR - A Proximity Sensor that Measures Angles
This is an example for the Protractor Sensor. This example will demonstrate how to change the I2C address 
of the Protractor. Changes to the Protractor's I2C address do not take effect until after the Protractor
is rebooted.

ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS

To use the Protractor with an Arduino over I2C, make the following connections:
_________________________________________________________________
  PROTRACTOR    |   UNO     |  LEONARDO |   MEGA    |   DUE     |
--------------POWER----------------------------------------------
    GND         |   GND     |   GND     |   GND     |   GND     |  Connect Power Supply GND to Arduino GND and Protractor GND.
    Vin         |   Vin     |   Vin     |   Vin     |   Vin     |  NOTE: Vin must be between 6V to 14V.
---------------I2C-----------------------------------------------
    DG/DGND     |   GND     |   GND     |   GND     |   GND     |  
    VCC         |   5V      |   5V      |   5V      |   3.3V    |  Protractor VCC can be 3.3V to 5V. Used for communication only.
    SDA         |   SDA/A4  |   SDA/2   |   SDA/20  |   SDA/20  |  Protractor has built-in level shifters
    SCL         |   SCL/A5  |   SCL/3   |   SCL/21  |   SCL/21  |  Protractor has built-in level shifters
